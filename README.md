# Basics
This repository will contain the basic knowledge of C++ built from the ground up. The goal is to make sure that all the basic knowledge are well implemented. I intend to maintain it and update it according to the new knowledge that I get from newer or more efficient versions or concepts of the language (at this moment C++20)

## Elements 
1- Hello word </br>
2- Variable declaration and assignment.
